# ATS Resume Issues

The list of ATS issues below should be used to avoided this mistakes in the resume and noted with an alternative version for replacement.

## File Format & Text Recognition Problems
- Scanned PDFs or image-only files — ATS cannot extract text from images, so a scanned doc may appear “blank.”
- Unsupported file types (e.g., .pages, .rtf, .jpg, .png) — many ATS can’t parse them at all.
- PDFs with embedded fonts or exported from design tools — these often break parsing even when the text appears readable.
- Password-protected or encrypted files — no text can be extracted.

## Content Layout & Structural Errors
- Two-column or multi-column layouts — ATS reads left-to-right, top-to-bottom; columns scramble order.
- Tables & nested table structures — text inside tables can be misordered or skipped.
- Text in headers/footers or sidebars — many ATS ignore these sections.
- Text boxes and floating elements — content may be overlooked or appear in the wrong parse field.
- Columns mixed with bullets and indents — disrupts parsing order.

## Visual Styles & Decorative Elements
- Images, icons, logos, graphs, or charts — ATS cannot read text within them, so that info is invisible.
- Colored text, shading, or backgrounds — some systems read only plain black text.
- Special characters & decorative symbols (e.g., stars, emojis) — may be ignored or misread as garbled text.
- Fancy or uncommon fonts — ATS may misinterpret glyphs or fail to recognize them.

## Section Headings & Organization Problems
- Non-standard headings (e.g., “My Journey,” “What I Bring”) — ATS may not recognize the content underneath.
- Missing key sections like Skills, Work Experience, and Education — ATS looks for these to classify info.
- Mixing label styles (e.g., Experience vs. Work History vs. Professional Background) — inconsistent parsing.
- Lack of clear section breaks (line spacing/formatting) — ATS may blur sections together.

## Date & Timeline Issues
- Inconsistent date formatting (e.g., “Jan 20,” “1/20,” “2020-01”) — ATS may miscalculate experience timelines.
- Missing dates for roles or education — ATS can’t determine chronology or experience span.

## Keyword & Content Recognition Issues
- Lack of job-relevant keywords — ATS matches keywords against job descriptions for ranking.
- Overuse or “keyword stuffing” — modern ATS may penalize unnatural repetition.
- Acronyms not spelled out — ATS may only recognize the full term first.
- Synonyms instead of exact terms used in the job ad — a resume saying “backend development” may not match a job asking for “server-side development.”

## Contact & Identifiers Issues
- Contact info buried in headers/footers or graphics — ATS may not extract email/phone.
- Missing or improperly formatted email/URL — ATS rejects uploads if it can’t parse an email.
- Unclear name placement — ATS may mislabel names if not at the top in plain text.

## Miscellaneous Technical Problems
- Excessively dense text with no white space — makes reliable extraction harder.
- Justified text alignment can create inconsistent spacing that’s misread by parsers.
- Hidden formatting characters from copy/paste or templates — invisible characters confuse parsing.
- Incorrect or unclear job titles — if your title doesn’t align with industry keywords, ATS may fail to match.
