# Resume formatting rules

Use the rules listed below to identify formatting issues.

- Choose the right overall format
	- Reverse-chronological is generally best—most recent roles first — because it highlights career progression and is ATS-friendly.
	- Consider a combination/hybrid format if you have non-linear experience, relevant skills outside traditional roles, or career changes.
	- Avoid purely functional resumes unless you have very little experience (as many recruiters distrust them).

- Header & Contact Information
	- Include: Full Name, Professional Title, Phone, Professional Email, City/State/Country.
	- Add LinkedIn, GitHub, and personal portfolio/website links (if you have one).
	- Ensure email and URLs are professional and clickable in PDFs.

- ATS-Friendly Layout
	- Use standard fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman), 10–12pt.
	- Avoid graphics, photos, icons, tables, and text boxes—they can break parsing by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).
	- Prefer single-column layouts so ATS reads your resume left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
	- Save and submit as PDF (or ATS-friendly .docx if specifically requested). PDFs preserve formatting.

- Sections & Order
	- Professional Summary / Objective (2–3 sentences) that aligns with the job you’re applying for.
	- Technical Skills grouped by category (languages, frameworks, tools, cloud, DevOps).
	- Work Experience next (most relevant/impactful first).
	- Projects (especially for junior roles or gaps); include links (GitHub, live demos).
	- Education & Certifications (separate certifications if tech-specific).

- Content & Clarity
	- Use clear, descriptive job titles that match industry norms (e.g., “Software Developer” not “Coding Ninja”).
	- Write concise bullet points (3–5 per role) with measurable impact: e.g., “Improved CI/CD rollout speed by 40% using GitHub Actions.”
	- Start bullets with strong action verbs (Developed, Automated, Implemented, Optimized).
	- Quantify achievements when possible (%, time savings, performance gains).
	- Tailor your resume for each job by matching keywords exactly as they appear in the job posting.

- Skills Area Best Practices
	- Group your skills logically (e.g., “Programming Languages,” “DevOps Tools,” “Cloud Platforms”).
	- Only list technologies/tools you truly know—don’t keyword stuff.
	- Keep your skills section concise but relevant (8–15 top skills).

- Readability & Professionalism
	- Maintain consistent formatting (font sizes, dates, bullet styles).
	- Use Ample white space and clear headings for readability.
	- Avoid excessive color, unusual fonts, or long paragraphs.
	- One page is ideal for early careers (0–8 years); two pages are acceptable for senior levels if everything adds value.

- Extra Tips for QA & DevOps
	- For Quality Assurance/QA roles, emphasize test frameworks (Selenium, Cypress), automation results, and test coverage improvements with metrics.
	- For DevOps, highlight CI/CD tools, containerization, cloud infrastructure technologies, and pipeline improvements clearly.
	- Keep certifications separate from education to showcase continuous learning (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Kubernetes).
