# Recommendations to use when writing a resume

## Work Experience Bullet Points

Every bullet on your resume should pass the "So what?" test.

❌ Weak: "Managed social media accounts"
→ So what? Anyone can post.

✅ Strong: "Grew Instagram following 340% in 6 months by testing 47 content formats—identified 3 that drove 80% of engagement"

The formula:
[Action verb] + [Specific task] + [Quantified result] + [Context that shows difficulty]
